<h4>Effect of Moisture Diffusion in Concrete and Epoxy – H.R. Hamilton III</h4>
<p>Around 25% of bridges across the nation are considered deficient. Fiber Reinforced Polymer (FRP) composite materials are becoming one of the most prominent methods for repair of decayed bridges. FRP is externally bonded to the structural member by means of epoxy adhesive to add additional strength to the structural member and prevent its cracking. It was found that high level of moisture affect the bonding mechanism at the interface between epoxy and concrete. This project deals with researching and applying different material characterization methods to determine the cause of bond decay. Methods that will be utilized to achieve the objective are: scanning electron microscopy (SEM), scanning probe microscopy (SPM), nanoindentation, X-ray diffraction, and others.</p>

<h4>Experimental Investigation of the Effect of Surface Markings on the Mechanical Integrity of Weathering Bridge Steels – Michele Manuel</h4>
<p>With the introduction of advanced marking techniques, there is a need for standardization of the marking and identification of weathering steels used for bridge construction. Such standardization will improve efficiency by reducing the time needed to manually mark and identify structures. However, the effect of these marking techniques on material properties must be properly explored before their widespread adoption. When notches (defects) are introduced onto the surface of a material subjected to a load, stress will concentrate locally at the notch1. The presence of the notch is expected to reduce the strength of the material by a factor Kt, the theoretical stress concentration factor. It is known that notch depth and angle can affect the fatigue strength of structural members. This research program seeks to understand the effect of marking techniques on the underlying microstructure and fatigue performance in weathering bridge steels.</p>

<h4>Design of Brittle Ductile Laminates for Crack Arresting Structures – Jack Mecholsky</h4>
<p>This project is a multifaceted study of the effect of lamination on being able to arrest cracks in structures.  It involves modeling, experimentation, characterization and analysis. The student will learn how to critically analyze mechanical property data from the failure of ceramic-polymer laminate composites.  The toughness of the composites will be compared to the monolithic ceramic materials.  The fracture processes of these composites have been performed by other students.  What is needed is an analysis of the fracture surfaces using a fractal geometric technique.  Fractal geometry is a non-Euclidean geometry which allows non-integer dimensions.  Thus a fracture surface can have a geometric dimension of 2.3, for example.  This number means that fracture surface is not a flat surface, but rather has texture above the flat plane.  In fact, the value of 2.3, in our example, is called the fractal dimension and is directly related to the toughness of the material.  The importance of these specific composites is that the ceramic is hydroxyapatite, the mineral substance of bone, and the polymer is a biocompatible material for placement in the body.  The composites have mechanical properties that mimic bone properties.  However, the principles learned in this study will be applicable to many ceramic-polymer and brittle-ductile laminate composites.</p>

<h4>Electroceramic Fibers for Smart Composites – Juan Nino</h4>
<p>Students will learn several methods for fiber synthesis and will manufacture fibers of various diameters ranging from nanometers to millimeters. The REU participant will also perform morphological characterization using electron microscopy and electrical property characterization of fiber mats and composites.</p>

<h4>Structural Tests on Exterior Corners of Light-Framed Wood Residential Structures – David O. Prevatt</h4>
<p>The objective of this research is to characterize the structural response of exterior wall junctions (i.e. corners, T-wall junctions) in residential structures to tornado wind loads. This proposal will support the research of an REU student who will work with a graduate student of the Prevatt Research Group to construct and test full-scale mock-ups of light-framed wood exterior corners and T-junction walls. The performance of connections made using nails and with metal straps would be compared.  The student will use an existing multi-valve pressure loading actuator system, data acquisition device, and instrumentation to measure failure pressures and displacements of the structure. A final report will be prepared summarizing the methodologies and test setup, analysis results, and conclusions.  This research will enable improved understanding of how tornado-resilient houses can be constructed in the future.</p>

<h4>Novel Sensors for Structural Health Monitoring – Jennifer Rice</h4>
<p>Our nation’s aging infrastructure demands new technologies and approaches to monitoring structural performance and safety. This project seeks to apply new sensor technologies, e.g. wireless, piezoelectric, radar, etc., to improve structural testing and assessment strategies. Tasks will range from laboratory-scale, single sensor characterization to full-scale bridge testing with a network of sensors. This project will provide a broad range of experience related to structural dynamics, sensor technology and experimental techniques.</p>

<h4>Heterogeneous Interface Design – Susan Sinnott</h4>
<p>Nanometer-scale simulations will be used to investigate the properties of heterogeneous interfaces (ceramic/metal, ceramic/ceramic, ceramic/polymer, metal/polymer) that are important for infrastructure applications. These simulations will reveal the role of composition and structure on the physical, mechanical, and chemical properties of the interface, thus providing structure-property relationships that will advance the design of interfaces with improved properties.</p>

<h4>Self-Healing Materials – Henry Sodano</h4>
<p>Dr. Sodano's group is pursuing the development of biologically inspired materials that can autonomously adapt to their current state or surroundings through adaptation, self-healing and stimulus responsive behavior. The past few years have seen a surge of research into autonomous materials; however, the resulting techniques are completely passive, cannot sense the presence of damage to allow a controlled response and cannot be performed during operation. To ensure that the structure’s health is maintained, it is imperative that viable methodologies be developed that evaluate the state of the structure while simultaneously providing a means to mitigate damage and recover the material’s properties. Here, polymers incorporating pendent cinnamate moieties that undergo efficient photoreversible cycloaddition reactions will be developed. A fiber optic network will be used to signal damage and apply controlled wavelengths of light at the damage site to allow local adaptation to toughen the material following by shape recovery and healing using photodimerization. Past healing modalities have not acted to stop the propagation of damage or signal its presence. This basic research effort will ultimately provide a paradigm shift in the synthesis and implementation of autonomously responsive materials and create structures that respond to damage as biological systems do.</p>

<h4>Flexible Solar Cells for Mobile Infrastructure Monitoring –Xiangeng Xue</h4>
<p>For certain infrastructure monitoring purposes, such as for the monitoring of roads, bridges, or other remote areas, where the regular electricity grid is not accessible, it is desirable to have mobile power generation devices/systems to power the electronic monitoring systems.  Solar cells can directly convert sunlight to electricity, and have been used widely for distributed power generation.  However, existing solar panels, which are primarily based on silicon wafers, are bulky, heavy, and fragile, thus they are not very convenient for deployment.  This REU project will focus on developing organic semiconductor based solar cells for mobile infrastructure monitoring applications.  These solar cells can be fabricated in large areas and on flexible and light-weight substrates, thus leading to solar cells that are easily deployable.  In this project, the REU student will fabricate organic solar cells, and investigate approaches to improving their efficiency and lifetime.</p>

<h4>Engineered Zircaloy Cladding Modifications for Improved Accident Tolerance of LWR (Light Water Reactor) Fuel – Yong Yang</h4>
<p>This research is aimed to fabricate and evaluate modified Zircaloy LWR cladding under normal BWR/PWR operation and off-normal events. A combination of experimental and computation protocols will be employed to design and test modified Zircaloy cladding with respect to corrosion and accelerated oxide growth, the former associated with normal operation, the latter associated with steam exposure during loss of coolant accidents (LOCAs) or reactivity insertion accidents (RIAs) and low-pressure core refloods. Cladding performance evaluation will be incorporated into a reactor system modeling effort of fuel performance, neutronics, and thermal hydraulics, thereby providing a holistic approach to accident tolerant nuclear fuel. The proposed summer research activities will be focused on the evaluation of the corrosion behavior of engineered Zircaloy using an in-house Pressure Water Reactor (PWR) testing water loop. The kinetics of corrosion in PWR water will be studied using gain loss/gain methodology, and the morphologies, phases and chemical compositions of zirconium oxides will be studied using SEM, XRD and TEM, respectively.</p>
