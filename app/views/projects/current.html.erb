This project seeks to apply new sensor technologies, e.g. wireless, piezoelectric, radar, etc., to improve structural testing and assessment strategies.  Tasks will range from laboratory-scale, single sensor characterization to full-scale bridge testing with a network of sensors.  This project will provide a broad range of experience related to structural dynamics, sensor technology and experimental techniques.</p>

<h4>Electroceramic Fibers for Smart Composites – Juan Nino</h4>

The REU participant will also perform morphological characterization using electron microscopy and electrical property characterization of fiber mats and composites.</p>

<h4>Energy Harvesting from Infrastructure Materials – Jacob Jones</h4>
<p>Piezoelectric materials can convert mechanical energy such as vibrations into electrical energy and are therefore being used for continuous energy harvesting from ambient vibrations. Such materials can be used to power infrastructure sensors and sensor networks without the need for replacement of batteries or wiring. In order to achieve optimal energy conversion efficiency, the resonance of the piezoelectric material device should be nearly equal to the input vibrational frequency. For infrastructure materials with relatively low ambient frequencies, the piezoelectric device should have a correspondingly low resonant frequency. This can be achieved by modifying the mechanical design of the piezoelectric device. The present project consists of two components related to both the input frequencies available and the optimal device design to use with these frequencies. The student will build and/or obtain a frequency monitoring device and use this device to measure the ambient vibrational frequencies of typical infrastructure materials, e.g. buildings or roadways. In parallel, the student will also examine several different mechanical design strategies for lowering the resonance frequencies of piezoelectric devices. This includes the evaluation of bender actuators of various size, shape, and mass, as well as other operational modes. At the conclusion of the project, the student will suggest the optimal piezoelectric device design for harvesting ambient vibrational energy from infrastructure materials.</p>

<h4>In situ studies of cement materials using X-ray and neutron scattering techniques- Jacob Jones</h4>
<p>The properties of infrastructure materials are largely dictated by their crystallographic structure. For example, the polymorphism of tricalcium silicate is strongly known to influence its mechanical strength. Advances in X-ray and neutron scattering techniques have created a wealth of new knowledge concerning the crystallographic structure of infrastructure materials, in particular the crystallographic structure during and after processing (e.g., hydration, dehydration). However, well-developed diffraction strain measurement techniques which have been used extensively to study the structural behavior of engineering materials, have not been widely applied to investigate the mechanical behavior of infrastructure materials. Such techniques can measure the crystallographic elastic and plastic deformation behavior during mechanical loading. The lack of application of such methods was recently highlighted in the work by Skibsted and Hall. This REU project will demonstrate the feasibility of these characterization techniques for in situ studies of elastic and plastic deformation behavior of infrastructure materials. The material to be investigated will be tricalcium silicate, a major constituent in Portland cement clinker. Powder materials will first be investigated by laboratory X-ray diffraction at the University of Florida. The student will be mentored by Jones and his research team in the use of crystallographic refinement (e.g., the Rietveld method) to confirm the crystal structure at room temperature. The student will then determine the crystallographic structure as a function of hydrostatic pressure using high-pressure neutron diffraction at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. A postdoc on Jones’ team is partially supported by ORNL and is located at ORNL during a large portion of the year. This postdoc will mentor the student and will facilitate these measurements. These high-pressure measurements will enable the structure to be determined as a function of isostatic stress, a precursor to the measurement of this material under multiaxial stress states using instrumentation such as VULCAN at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS).</p>

<h4>Self-Healing Materials – Henry Sodano</h4>
<p>Dr. Sodano's group is pursuing the development of biologically inspired materials that can autonomously adapt to their current state or surroundings through adaptation, self-healing and stimulus responsive behavior. The past few years have seen a surge of research into autonomous materials; however, the resulting techniques are completely passive, cannot sense the presence of damage to allow a controlled response and cannot be performed during operation. To ensure that the structure’s health is maintained, it is imperative that viable methodologies be developed that evaluate the state of the structure while simultaneously providing a means to mitigate damage and recover the material’s properties.  Here, polymers incorporating pendent cinnamate moieties that undergo efficient photoreversible cycloaddition reactions will be developed.  A fiber optic network will be used to signal damage and apply controlled wavelengths of light at the damage site to allow local adaptation to toughen the material following by shape recovery and healing using photodimerization. Past healing modalities have not acted to stop the propagation of damage or signal its presence. This basic research effort will ultimately provide a paradigm shift in the synthesis and implementation of autonomously responsive materials and create structures that respond to damage as biological systems do.</p>

<h4>Materials for Energy Harvesting – Henry Sodano</h4>
<p>The use of piezoceramic materials for structural actuation is a fairly well developed practice that has found use in a wide variety of applications.  However, just as advanced composites offer numerous benefits over traditional engineering materials for structural design, actuators that utilize the active properties of piezoelectric fibers can improve upon many of the limitations encountered when using monolithic piezoceramic devices.  The proposed research program will seek to create new synthesis, modeling and characterization approaches for the development of multifunctional materials that utilize a carbon fiber coated with a piezoelectric material.  The research will specifically develop two novel processes for the conformal deposition of piezoceramic materials on carbon fiber while in a tow consisting of thousands of fibers.  This novel fiber would make advances in the safety and performance of modern structures through the intelligent integration of sensing, actuation and energy harvesting into the material.</p>

<h4>Nanofibers for Energy Harvesting – Jennifer Andrew</h4>

<h4>Failure Analysis of Racing Engine Components – Gerhard Fuchs</h4>
<p>Failures have occurred in anti-friction coatings on piston skirts and roller lifter bearings in 1008 cubic inch Pro Mod drag racing engines.  This research project will work to characterize the failure and determine the failure mechanism(s) on each component.  The student will characterize the failure using optical microscopes and SEM fractographic analysis.  The student will also work with the racing engine builder who supplied the failed components.</p>

<h4>Design and Development of High Performance Shape Memory Alloys – Michele Manuel</h4>
<p>As a vital constituent in the field of smart materials and structures, shape memory alloys (SMAs) are becoming ever-moreimportant due to their wide range of commercial and industrial applicationssuch as reinforcement in concrete structures due to its stiffening and dampening properties. However, a major obstacle preventing SMAs from fulfilling is their potential  is the the degradation of mechanical properties and shape memory behavior due to cyclic fatigue. Thus, this research program seeks to develop novel NiTi-based SMAs that operate over a large number cycles while being able to provide high recovery forces.</p>

<h4>Engineered Zircaloy Cladding Modifications for Improved Accident Tolerance of LWR (Light Water Reactor) Fuel – Yong Yang</h4>
<p>This research is aimed to fabricate and evaluate modified Zircaloy LWR cladding under normal BWR/PWR operation and off-normal events. A combination of experimental and computation protocols will be employed to design and test modified Zircaloy cladding with respect to corrosion and accelerated oxide growth, the former associated with normal operation, the latter associated with steam exposure during loss of coolant accidents (LOCAs) or reactivity insertion accidents (RIAs) and low-pressure core refloods. Cladding performance evaluation will be incorporated into a reactor system modeling effort of fuel performance, neutronics, and thermal hydraulics, thereby providing a holistic approach to accident tolerant nuclear fuel. The proposed summer research activities will be focused on the evaluation of the corrosion behavior of engineered Zircaloy using an in-house Pressure Water Reactor (PWR) testing water loop. The kinetics of corrosion in PWR water will be studied using gain loss/gain methodology, and the morphologies, phases and chemical compositions of zirconium oxides will be studied using SEM, XRD and TEM, respectively.</p>

<h4>Development and testing of pressure sensors for hurricane wind load monitoring – Kurt Gurley</h4>
<p>The focus of this project is the interaction of the hurricane wind hazard with manmade infrastructure. Pressure sensors are currently be designed for placement on the roofs of coastal houses prior to land fall of a hurricane. These sensors will record the dynamic hurricane wind loads acting on the structure, and provide the means to quantify the vulnerability of the structure to damage. Testing of these sensors will be conducted in the spring and summer of 2013. Algorithms will be developed to post-process the collected for quality control and analysis. The REU student will work with a team of graduate and undergraduate students. Tasks will include experimental work, computer programming, data analysis and co-authorship of conference and journal manuscripts.</p>

<h4>Design of brittle ductile laminates for crack arresting structures – Jack Mecholsky</h4>
<p>This project is a multifaceted study of the effect of lamination on being able to arrest cracks in structures.  It involves modeling, experimentation, characterization and analysis. The student will learn how to critically analyze mechanical property data from the failure of ceramic-polymer laminate composites.  The toughness of the composites will be compared to the monolithic ceramic materials.  The fracture processes of these composites have been performed by other students.  What is needed is an analysis of the fracture surfaces using a fractal geometric technique.  Fractal geometry is a non-Euclidean geometry which allows non-integer dimensions.  Thus a fracture surface can have a geometric dimension of 2.3, for example.  This number means that fracture surface is not a flat surface, but rather has texture above the flat plane.  In fact, the value of 2.3, in our example, is called the fractal dimension and is directly related to the toughness of the material.  The importance of these specific composites is that the ceramic is hydroxyapatite, the mineral substance of bone, and the polymer is a biocompatible material for placement in the body.  The composites have mechanical properties that mimic bone properties.  However, the principles learned in this study will be applicable to many ceramic-polymer and brittle-ductile laminate composites.</p>

<h4>Effect of Moisture Diffusion in Concrete and Epoxy – H. R. Hamilton III</h4>
<p>It has been shown by previous research that the failure mode of externally FRP reinforced concrete changes from cohesive (failure in the concrete layer) to adhesive (failure in the adhesive or in the interfacial failure between the adhesive and concrete) when such systems are exposed to moist conditions. The purpose of this project is to determine the moisture diffusion mechanisms that affect the bond strength and failure modes of externally applied FRP reinforcement. In order to determine the effects of moisture diffusion three types of specimens will be prepared and tested: (1) concrete specimen with a layer of Plexiglas adhered by epoxy to the bond area (to determine the water penetration through the concrete and its effects on the epoxy layer); (2) concrete specimen painted with a waterproof paint with a bond area exposed to a moist environment (in order to determine the water diffusion through the bond region); and (3) GFRP and CFRP fabric saturated by epoxy and subjected to the moist conditions (to determine the effect of fibers on epoxy moisture diffusion). The change in weight of exposed specimens will be monitored over the time in order to determine the water contents.</p>

<h4>Direct Shear Test of Epoxy-Concrete Bond – H. R. Hamilton III</h4>
<p>Fiber-reinforced polymer FRP composites have been used for a number of years to repair and strengthen civil aging infrastructure.  One method is for FRP composites with carbon or glass fibers to be bonded to the surface of concrete to improve strength and serviceability.  This bond is critical to the long-term integrity of the strengthening system.  The proposed REU project is intended to further develop a test method that evaluates the adhesive failure properties of epoxy bonded to concrete.  Two-inch mortar cubes with varying surface roughness are glued together with epoxy.  The cubes are loaded in such a manner as to produce direct shear on the adhered surface.  Instrumentation needs to be developed so that the specimen displacement can be reliably measured.  This allows the measurement of Mode II fracture energy required to failure the specimen.  It is suspected, based on previous work, that fracture energy is a better predictor of adhesive bond capacity than ultimate strength.  By correlating the measured fracture energy to the measured surface roughness and applying extrapolation techniques it will be possible to form a dependence curve of fracture energy vs surface roughness. Furthermore, this may prove valuable in quantifying the bond strength of FRP reinforced concrete members which failure is controlled by the strength of concrete‐epoxy interface (members exposed to moist environments).</p>
