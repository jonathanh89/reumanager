Dear Applicant,

Thank you for your interest in the NSF Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) in Regenerative Medicine, Multi-Scale Bioengineering, and Systems Biology at the University of California, San Diego. The response to our program was overwhelming- we received several hundred applications for only ten positions. Although I cannot offer you a position in the program at this time, because of the strength of your application I would like to place you on our short wait list. If you have already made alternate plans for the summer please let me know. Otherwise, I will be in touch to give you an update in ~2 weeks. Thank you for your patience.

Sincerely,
Melissa
